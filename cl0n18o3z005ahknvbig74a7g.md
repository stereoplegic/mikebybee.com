## Don't sign up for Hashnode with email address.

I spent hours last night and today waiting for magic links which, more often than not, didn't actually work for logging in.

Since there's no way to connect other SSO accounts, trying to login with GitHub resulted in Hashnode attempting to create a brand new account for me (with the same email address). Of course, that failed (silently). The few times I did manage to log in with a magic email link (only delayed 15 minutes to an hour, as opposed to the several hours I waited other times, after refreshing my inbox and checking my spam folder over and over again to no avail).

I'm in now, via GitHub SSO, but only after I deleted my account created with email/magic links.

@hashnode simple email/password option would eliminate both issues. Just sayin'...
